Help Desk Ticket System
This program allows a user to either create or view a help desk ticket.
When creating a ticket, the user can select the category of their issue and a text box for them to describe their problem.
When viewing tickets, you can select from a list of ticket ID, and it will display the ticket ID, category of the issue, user description of the issue, and the time and date of creation.
